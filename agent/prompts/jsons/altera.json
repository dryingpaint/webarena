  "game_env": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. Only issue an action that is valid given the current observation.\n2. Only issue one action at a time.\n3. Do not repeat actions. If you continue to execute the same action and the webpage doesn't change, it's not a valid action.\n4. Issue the stop action when you think you have achieved the objective.\n5. You are not allowed to go to other webpages.\n",
  "action_space": "\nPage Operation Actions:\n`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage. The id must be a number corresponding to an element in the website tree.\n`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0. The id must be a number corresponding to an element in the website tree. The content must be in brackets. The [press_enter_after=0|1] field should just be 0 or 1. Example: type [21][My Name][1].\n`hover [id]`: Hover over an element with id. The id must be a number corresponding to an element in the website tree.\n`press [key_comb]`:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n`scroll [direction=down|up]`: Scroll the page up or down. The [direction=down|up] should just be down or up. Example: scroll [down].\n\nTab Management Actions:\n`new_tab`: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n`tab_focus [tab_index]`: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n`close_tab`: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n`goto [url]`: Navigate to a specific URL.\n`go_back`: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n`go_forward`: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as \"N/A\" in the bracket.\n",
